# Chapter 1 - Setting up your stripped down bot

# Step 1: Download your .zip file

To download your .zip file head to the main centre of this repo or use this hyperlink [here](https://github.com/TheCrazyCatKidz/Welcome-Bot/raw/main/DOWNLOAD%20ME.zip).

# Step 2: Extract your .zip file

Using your unzipper of your choice, unzip the .zip contents into a folder.

# Step 3: Install required dependencies

Assuming you have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, open your local terminal and go to your folder using terminal commands (using cd most of the time).
After this run **npm i** since the package-lock.json will take care of installing for you.

# Step 4: Running your stripped down bot

To run your bot, assuming your terminal is in the folder where the bot is located, run **node .** and fill out the data the bot requests. Most of the time after inviting the bot to your server with the link you were given, you need to press CTRL+C to stop the bot and re run **node .**
