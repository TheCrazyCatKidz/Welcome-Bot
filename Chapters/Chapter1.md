# Chapter 1 - Setting up your stripped down bot

# Step 1: Download your .zip file

To download your .zip file head to the main centre of this repo, click on **DOWNLOAD ME.zip** then click the **Download** button or use this hyperlink [here](https://github.com/TheCrazyCatKidz/Welcome-Bot/raw/main/DOWNLOAD%20ME.zip).

This .zip file is safe. Feel free to run a [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) or look at the [pre-made result](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/6806d6a8c7a7de0612286e640e1cf78bebbbc8a3f3ecba217aff7019db9e125a/detection) we already did.

# Step 2: Extract your .zip file

Using your unzipper of your choice, unzip the .zip contents into a folder. We advise you use [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) as it is the easiest zip management tool for our projects **(NOT AN AD)**.

# Step 3: Install required dependencies

Assuming you have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, open your local terminal and go to your folder using terminal commands (using cd most of the time).
After this run **npm install** since the package-lock.json will take care of installing for you.

# Step 4: Running your stripped down bot

To run your bot, assuming your terminal is in the folder where the bot is located, run **node index.js** and fill out the data the bot requests. Most of the time after inviting the bot to your server with the link you were given, you need to press CTRL+C to stop the bot and re run **node index.js**

That is all for this chapter!
